    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Pets First is a fully equipped veterinary facility. We have a full service in-house animal laboratory that allows us to perform immediate testing on critical cases for pets. Additionally, we have advanced pet dentistry equipment. We have machines for monitoring vital signs on anesthetized patients, as well as blood pressure monitors and other advanced diagnostic equipment for pets.  We are also American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) certified.</p>
    <p>Veterinarian, Dr. Brian V. Benjamin and Pets First work very closely with multiple pet rescue organizations in an attempt to help less fortunate abandoned pets that may be in need of veterinarian medical care or assistance in being prepared for pet adoption or pet foster care.</p>
    <p>At Pets First, our goal is to make pet owners and their pets as comfortable as possible during your veterinarian visit. Pets First strives to provide pets with decreased wait time, and always make client service a priority. Additionally, all of the Veterinarians at Pets First enjoy rewarding our patients with as much T.L.C. as possible. We are very flexible and will do anything we can to make the visit less stressful for your loved pets – dogs, cats and more. Dr. Benjamin chooses his veterinary team members very carefully and specifically looks for individuals that can help him achieve these goals.</p>

We know you will be very happy with our services. Our veterinarians and staff are devoted to staying on top of the latest diagnostics, treatments, and wellness programs to maintain your pet’s optimal health. Let’s work together to keep your beloved furry friend happy and healthy!
We look forward to meeting you and your pets!</p>
      <p>When you arrive for your appointment, you will be greeted warmly, and we’ll usher you into an examination room after checking in your pet. In most cases, one of our veterinary technicians will start by asking about your pet’s medical history, current condition and the reason for your visit, gathering data for the doctor. Then, one of our veterinarians will examine your pet, ask you further questions and then may recommend diagnostic tests if needed. Once the tests have been run, which can usually be done in the practice, your doctor will discuss a possible diagnosis and treatment plan if warranted.</p>
      <p>Our veterinary team wants to make sure you’re completely comfortable with the information we’re providing. Our veterinary technician will likely come back to wrap things up and will provide you with helpful pet care information and answer wellness and care questions for you. Our front desk staff will process your payment and schedule any needed follow up.</p>

      <h4>Microchipping Saves Lives!!</h4>
      <p>1 in 3 pets go missing during its lifetime and without proper ID 90% never return home. To ensure permanent identification that cannot get lost, we recommend the Home Again Microchip.
A microchip is about the size of a grain of rice that is implanted under your pet’s skin between their shoulder blades. The process only takes a few seconds and is very similar to a routine shot. We then register your contact information with a national pet recovery database.
Today, more than 6.5 million pets are enrolled with Home Again. They are responsible for reuniting more than 600,000 lost pets with their owners.</p>
      <p>A pet microchip creates a forever bond between you and the pet you love. A HomeAgain microchip with enrollment will give your pet the best chance of coming back home to you.
Call us today for further information or to schedule your pet’s appointment.</p>
